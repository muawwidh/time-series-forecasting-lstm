# Time Series Forecasting using LSTM

This repository demonstrates **time series forecasting** using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The code and analysis are provided in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict future values in a time series dataset using deep learning (LSTM).
- **Approach:** Data preparation, LSTM model building/training, and forecasting evaluation.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, TensorFlow, Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/time-series-forecasting-lstm.git
cd time-series-forecasting-lstm
````

### 2. Install dependencies

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the notebook

Open the notebook with Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code:

```bash
jupyter notebook Time-Series-Forecasting.ipynb
```

Or open `Time-Series-Forecasting.ipynb` directly in VS Code.
